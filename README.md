## My Portfolio

### I have used 3 languages to make this portfolio

* Html
* Css
* Javascript

___
##### I have learned and applied a function with 
javascript that adds animation once
the website loads because my animation plays 
while website is loading, which is a bummer.
I did it with a lot of research and trials.

##### The solution I found

* adding the windows.addEventListener('load' => {})

### Future Plans

* I am planning to add a horizontal drag scroll for my projects and a paralax effects for the whole website
* I also wanna add a wheel in the top page which can be crolled to access different icon links
